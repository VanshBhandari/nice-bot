### nice-bot
#### Overview
This [discord bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=934355049231036466&permissions=2048&scope=bot) replies to every text that has '69' in it.
#### How it works
The bot uses [discordpy](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to read messages and respond by saying 'nice' to every text that has 69 in it. I am running this bot on a [flask server](https://github.com/VanshBhandari/nice-bot/blob/main/server.py) so that it always stays active.
